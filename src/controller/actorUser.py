## @brief      This class represents the controller of the application.
##             This class is reponsible for execute the actions requested
##             by the user through the UI. At the first version of the
##             eplusplus, the basic methods are generate the cases and
##             run the simulation.

	## @brief      This method receives all parameters through UI.
	##             We don't need to check each value of the args, because
	##             this was already made at the UI. Depending of the method
	##             , the respective sampling method will be called. If the
	##             "LHS" method was choosed, the interpolation of values
	##             will be calculated too. Next, we save the values into a
	##             temporary csv file and write the new idf files. At the
	##             end, we delete the temporary csv file.
	##
	## @param      self          Non static method.
	## @param      pathToIdf     The path to idf file informed through UI.
	## @param      pathToCsv     The path to csv file informed through UI.
	## @param      pathToFolder  The path to folder where the new idf's
	##                           file will be saved. Also informed through
	##                           UI.
	## @param      sampleSize    The sample of size requested by the user.
	##                           Informed through UI.
	## @param      method        The method of sampling. Informed through
	##                           UI.
