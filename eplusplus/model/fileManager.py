## @brier This class is responsible for get the values from the csv file
##        informed by the user and also to write the new values into the idf
##        files. This class transform the values from the csv into a dictionary
##        of lists which list represents a column from the csv, following the
##        order in the csv. The list in each entry has all possible values. This
##        class also writes the "mappedValues" obtained from "mapValues" method
##        of the Statiscal class. The import of the os is used to get the name
##        of the idf file. The csv library is  needed cause we need to open the
##        csv.

	## @brief      This method creates a dictionary based on the CSV file. Each
	##             entry maps to a list. In the first iteration we create a
	##             entry on the dictionary to represent the variable and we
	##             store the "header" in the atribute of this class. We will use
	##             this value at the "writeMappedValues" later (see its
	##             documentation). In all other iterations we check if the value
	##             is in the list that represent that variable. If not, we
	##             append the new value. At the end, we have a Hash that map
	##             each variable to a list with respctives all possible values.

	##
	## @brief      This method is the core of the first use case. This method
	##             reads the temporary csv file and the idf file. After that,
	##             it reads line by line of the csv, which represents a sample.
	##             For each sample, a new idf file will be created. This is
	##             necessary, because each idf represents a case. Next, we
	##             start to iterate line by line of the idf until find the
	##             "@@" sequence, its a specie of a template. We can check
	##             if the "@@" sequence is at the line just checking the first
	##             member (line[0]) and check if the line is not empty to not
	##             have problems with exception. If this condition is not
	##             attended, this means that is just a normal line and we just
	##             have to write it.Finally, we map the value using the "index"
	##             function. The index function receives the element that we are
	##             serching, and returns the position at the list.
	##             The final if is just to bring the comments in the
	##             old the idf to the new. We repeat the process for each
	##             sample (row in the csv).
